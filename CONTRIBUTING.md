Thanks for contributing to doQuery!

Running the demo locally is relatively easy:

```
git clone https://github.com/guptasomnath/doQuery.git
cd doQuery
npm install # or yarn
npm run build

```


`Make a new folder where you cloned the 'doQuery' repository and create an npm project using this command.`

```npm init --y```

`Now, open your terminal in the 'test' folder and enter the following command to acquire the 'do query' package locally. Ensure that you also build the 'doQuery'.`

``` npm link ../doQuery ```

`Now test`

`node index.js`


## `build` files

There is **no need** to build or commit files in `build` after making changes.
